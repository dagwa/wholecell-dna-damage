DNA_damage_full.sbgn
=====================

SBGN map generated using VANTED with tool SBGN-ED. Contains all ~140 reactions contained in the knowledgebase, even those omitted from the simulation (due to rates unknown / assumed to be 0).

DNA_damage_simulated.graphml
=====================

GraphML layout of the SBGN map generated using VANTED with tool SBGN-ED. (There were problems saving as SBGN-ML.) Limited to the 32 reactions actually simulated.

DNA_repair_final.sbgn
=====================

SBGN map generated using VANTED with tool SBGN-ED. 

Some nodes have been cloned in order to make it cleaner visually but the kinetics are described as found in the matlab code.
32 reactions are represented, numbers are related to the enzymes.
